# Embedded Systems Project Report: [Human Machine Interface]

## 1. Introduction

 This project focuses on developing a Human Machine Interface (HMI) system that monitors and displays environmental parameters such as temperature or light intensity on a LCD. Using analog sensors and an ADC for data acquisition, the system allows users to set upper and lower threshold limits through push buttons, while an LED or buzzer provides alerts when values exceed these limits. Implemented in native C without pre-built libraries, the project demonstrates low-level embedded programming.It reflects an industrial application scenario, such as a vehicle dashboard interface, and demonstrates key engineering competencies including sensor interfacing, real-time data acquisition, and system reliability within embedded environments.
